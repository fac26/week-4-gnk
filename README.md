#### Deployment

This application is hosted on Fly.io and can be accessed [here](https://fly.io/apps/frosty-sky-4626).

#### Running the project locally

1. `npm install`
2. `run npm dev` (GitHub OAuth will only work on the deployed site)
3. You'll be able to add events when logged in using the site's log-in feature (not yet under gitHub OAuth).
4. The `/add-event` route is not yet protected and can be accessed by all.

#### OAuth Notes

OAuth is currently under construction and does not yet display the 'Add Event' panel, despite being logged-in via OAuth withg GitHub.
_OAuth will only work on the deployed site_
